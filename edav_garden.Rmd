EDAV Garden is a [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) about EDAV.
In simple words, it is a collection of published notes, like [edav.info](https://edav.info).
However, EDAV Garden has some special features:

- It captures **my journey** of learning EDAV. It is a practice of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), learning for the public.
- The notes are not a collection of external information; instead, they are **my notes** containing my thoughts and interpretation.
- Therefore, there may be mistakes and question marks scattered around. But they may be fixed when you come back later.
- This is not a frozen garden; it is an **evolving garden** that I will continue gardening as I learn.
- This site is not only for you to reference, but also for you to **roam**.

## How to Explore the Garden

A significant difference between this garden and a traditional book/wiki/website is that notes here are **not linear**: they are not in chronological or logical order. Instead, they are connected to each other through contextual links and form a knowledge graph, making this garden explorable. This also matches the fundamental problem of EDAV: exploratory vs. explanatory. To navigate through different notes, you can follow different types of links, as illustrated below

- an outgoing link points to another note;
- a backlink points to a note which mentions the current note;
- the interactive graph presents all the connections the current note has.
