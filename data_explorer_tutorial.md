# Data Explorer Tutorial and Automation

Akshay Iyengar

I created a video tutorial on a shortcut known as data explorer. While this package is not talked about in class, it is emphasized to be a useful and fast data exploration package. My video will teach my classmates on how automation can be both useful and not useful at the same time.This especially is one of the many packages that does help with creating general visualizations for data scientists.
