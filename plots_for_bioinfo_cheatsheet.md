# Useful plots for Bioinfomatics in R

Xiangming Huang

This cheat sheet includes simple ways to create a survival curve, heatmap, and volcano plot. All those plots are useful for visualization and statistical analysis in Bioinformatics. Many R packages specialized in Biological analysis are available and free. Those packages are avoided in this cheatsheet when possible to help readers understand how data are processed and how plots are constructed in an elementary way.
