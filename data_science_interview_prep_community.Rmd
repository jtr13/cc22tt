# How I got into Amazon as a full time data analyst

Robin Zhao

I wrote a blog post about how I got into Amazon, as a full-time data analyst. Link: https://medium.com/@robinzhao39/how-i-become-a-data-analyst-at-amazon-after-undergrad-c8371081df13?source=friends_link&sk=96295ba3cd71b28d6e7d0b24527b01e2

Most master students in our class want to find a data analyst job during study or after graduation. This motivates me to write about my experiences to help them better understand the process. The blog includes how I learned essential data science skills, my college activities, and my interview process. The blog addresses the job searching/learning anxiety, provides potential directions to lost students, and gives clarity on big-tech interviews how to prepare for them.
