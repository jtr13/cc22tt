# Design homepage for class community

Morris Hsieh

Dear Prof, TAs, and all fellow students:

I choose to **design a home page** (images, text, and/or artwork) for the class community website to contribute to our community. The link to the website is:

https://edavcommunitycontribution.wordpress.com/Links to an external site.
 
The website includes the introduction part, the overview of the course and lecturer, and blog posts (fellows' sharing).

Sincerely,
Morris Hsieh
