# What you see is what you understand: learning data science visually

Rohan Poddar

*"Visualization is the process of making an external spatial representation of information. Visualizing is a useful strategy for discovering structure and organizing information efficiently"* (Schwartz, Tsang, & Blair, 2016, p. 277)

Data Science consists of a lot of abstract concepts like Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, and Machine Learning. I believe a great way to develop a strong understanding and intuition of these concepts is by learning through interactive visualizations. I have curated a list of resources that cover some of the important topics in a visually interactive way.

## Programming

### 1. Python Tutor

Link: <https://pythontutor.com/>

Writing code is very abstract and become difficult to follow as the length and complexity of the code increases. Python Tutor helps learn Python, JavaScript, C, C++, and Java programming by visualizing code execution.

### 2. Pandas Tutor

Link: <https://pandastutor.com/>

Transforming and manipulating Pandas data frames are the backbone of every Data Science project. However, manipulating data frames can become very complex to hard to follow. Using bulky print statements and copy-pasting snippets of the code to see what is happening can get cumbersome. Pandas Tutor lets you write code directly in the browser and helps visualize the data transformation step-by-step.

### 3. TidyData Tutor
