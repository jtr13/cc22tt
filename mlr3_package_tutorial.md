# mlr3 Package Tutorial

Lingjun Zhang and Michelle Sun

For data scientists, the topic of machine learning is indispensable no matter in school or in the workplace. Usually, people use Python to do the machine learning work. mlr3 is a package in R which could help people to do machine learning tasks in R. Here we provide a tutorial for this specific package.

mlr3 is an efficient, object-oriented programming on the building blocks of machine learning. Provides 'R6' objects for tasks, learners, resamplings, and measures. The package is geared towards scalability and larger datasets by supporting parallelization and out-of-memory data-backends like databases. While 'mlr3' focuses on the core computational operations, add-on packages provide additional functionality.

We rendered a book for readers to read easily and here is the link:
